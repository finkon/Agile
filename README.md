Agile

Project –
You are a Product Owner for an agency and a client has asked you to create a website for them to sell musical instruments to the public. 
• You’ve had a meeting with them to gather the requirements. 
• First create user stories from the requirements and fit them under one of the three categories (Database, Back-end, Front-end). This will form your Product backlog. 
• So you don’t overwork your team there is a point system for how much work each User Story is. For each user story that falls under Database gets 5 points, Back-end gets 4 points and Front-end gets 3 points. 
• For your team to make a start on the development you need to put the User Stories in each Sprint. You have 4 Sprints and can only add up to 9 points per Sprint. At the end of the 4 Sprints should be a fully functioning website the client will be happy with. 
• What User Stories do you choose per Sprint and why? Complete an Excel sheet with each User Story under each Sprint. Use a word document to write down your reasons.
